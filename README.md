# IgBot


## Quick history
I've been trying to learn more about how to code and trying to apply this knowledge into my daily routine as a hobby. This project has the purpose of automating Instagram's markings in a prize draw.

So, that's a bot to comment on a certain post that I choose.

**It's not to be used on a purpose to spread fake news**


## Tested

- 07/29/2020
- Google Chrome 84
- Python 3.8.2

## Instruction

To use the selenium I had to install it before and had to let the chromedriver.exe file on the path of the project
You can install in this link https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads the apropriete version to your Chrome navigator

You'll had to change the name of the 'data_list example.py' to 'data_lis.py' and do the modification that you need.

**That's a While True loop. So it'll be working all the time. To stop you'll have to interrup the code. **
